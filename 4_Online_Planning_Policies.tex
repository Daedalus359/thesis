\chapter{Online Planning Policies}

\section{Persistent (Learning) Policies}

In the last chapter, it was proved that the optimal policy with which to perform coverage depends on the distribution environments that policy will be asked to solve. In that chapter, this problem was approached by hand crafting policies to perform as well as possible on a complex distribution of environments through experimentation and tweaking of parameters. In this section, some policy implementations are developed that can recreate a version of this experimentation and tweaking across multiple scenarios. Importantly, these policies perform these tweaks \textit{automatically}, using the PersistentPolicy typeclass and associated environment interface tools to refine an approach specifically tuned to a distriution of environments encountered online.

It's worth addressing why this online learning behavior could be superior to a hand crafted approach. The distribution of real world environments in which you might want to deploy drone based robotic coverage is not at all easy to characterize. Furthermore, practical applications of this kind of  technology may see it deployed to various owners around the world. Any one of these teams of robots is likely to be deployed in environments with somewhat different properties the environments seen by other teams. As a result, there may be an opportunity to optimize the behavior of each of these teams of robots to the particular circumstances in which it is deployed. Such optimizations would not be easy to achieve through any sort of manual effort, so a well crafted policy that is capable of changing itself between individual operations may be the best way to achieve this optimization. In addition, there is some theoretical value in seeing how coverage policies can be automatically optimized for an experimentally determined distribution of environments. Much of the remainer of this chapter is devoted to exploring that topic.
