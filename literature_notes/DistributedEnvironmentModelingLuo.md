### Multi Robot Sensor Coverage

The *Multi-Robot Sensor Coverage Problem* is to figure out the optimal placement of each individual in a group of robots such that some measure of overall environment-sensing performance is optimized.

Apparently Centroidal Voronoi Tesellation is one optimal solution if the distribution of sensing targets in the environment **is known**

[13] may be a good reference for the case of perfect shared information


### Motivation

Real world scenario - monitoring crops with a preference for deployment near high yield plots

Goal - take as few samples as possible to get an idea of the distribution of crop yield over the environment
